What is Buildout?
-----------------

Buildout is a system for managing development buildouts. While often
identified as a Zope project, and indeed licensed under the ZPL by
Zope creator Jim Fulton, buildout is useful for configurations beyond
Zope, and even, in rare cases, a few that have nothing to do with
Python.


Features
--------

- Coarse-grained python-based configuration-driven build tool

- Tool for working with eggs

- Repeatable

- Configuration driven

- Developer oriented

- Python-based

- Can use with virtualenv
