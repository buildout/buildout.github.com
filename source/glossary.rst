   builder
      A class (inheriting from :class:`~sphinx.builder.Builder`) that takes
      parsed documents and performs an action on them.  Normally, builders
      translate the documents to an output format, but it is also possible to
      use the builder builders that e.g. check for broken links in the
      documentation, or build coverage information.

   configuration directory
      The directory containing :file:`conf.py`.  By default, this is the same
      as the :term:`source directory`, but can be set differently with the
      **-c** command-line option.

   description unit
      The basic building block of Sphinx documentation.  Every "description
      directive" creates such a unit; and most units can be cross-referenced
      to.

   environment
      A structure where information about all documents under the root is
      saved, and used for cross-referencing.  The environment is pickled after
      the parsing stage, so that successive runs only need to read and parse
      new and changed documents.

   source directory
      The directory which, including its subdirectories, contains all source
      files for one Sphinx project.
