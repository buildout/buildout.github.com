WHAT IS THIS PROJECT
====================

This project is to collect and improve the documentation for the "buildout"
tool in a form suitable for delivery via the website buildout.zope.org.  That
documentation is in the form of reStructuredText and relies upon the "sphinx"
tool to process it into HTML while automatically producing cross-references,
indices and such.

WHERE ARE THE SOURCE DOCUMENTS?
===============================

  source/

The Sphinx tool relies upon a "table of contents tree" to organize the various
source documents into a comprehensive whole.  This tree is specified in a
source document with the "toctree::" directive.  The topmost or master
document, as specified in source/conf.py, is source/index.rst.  All source
documents must end with the .rst filename extension.

Note that all documents under the source/ tree must appear in some *toctree*
directive and Sphinx wille emit a warning at document build time if this is
not so.
